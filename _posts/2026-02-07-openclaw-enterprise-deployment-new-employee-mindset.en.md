## At first, I didn’t dare to put OpenClaw inside the company network

Honestly, when you see such a powerful tool, it’s hard not to want to use it immediately.

But a company network contains customer data, internal documents, and all kinds of sensitive information. Letting an AI Agent access that directly? The security team would pin me to the wall.

![A dilemma: powerful tools vs fragile security](/assets/images/openclaw-security-slide-02.png)

Later, I switched to a different way of thinking:

**Treat OpenClaw like a brand-new employee.**

Once I saw it that way, many design choices suddenly made sense.

## New hire onboarding: create an account first

![New employee onboarding: build an independent digital identity](/assets/images/openclaw-security-slide-03.png)

What’s the first thing HR does for a new hire? A company email account.

I did the same for OpenClaw:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Employee account** | Google Workspace account (`openclaw@company.com`) |
| **Dedicated GitHub key** | A separate deploy key, not my personal one |
| **OAuth key** | An access key for Google Workspace APIs |

This account is like the new hire’s company mailbox—it can do work, but it’s not *me*.

## Permission design: manage AI the same way you manage a junior employee

### 1) Google Workspace: if you need access, you request it

![Permission design: request only what you need](/assets/images/openclaw-security-slide-04.png)

If a junior employee wants to view a document, the manager shares it with them first.

OpenClaw works the same way.

If I want it to process a document, I **share permission to that employee account**. It downloads based on granted access, processes it, and produces outputs.

Need to send a calendar invite? It remembers the recipients and sends it using *its own account*.

**Not my account—its account.**

### 2) Internal systems: enforce guardrails in code, not in prompts

![Code-level protection: don’t rely on prompts](/assets/images/openclaw-security-slide-06.png)

For internal system integrations, I use a written Skill.

The key is: **put the “forbidden actions” logic into the Skill’s code.**

```python
# Block dangerous operations at the code level
FORBIDDEN_ACTIONS = ['DELETE', 'DROP', 'TRUNCATE']

def execute_query(query):
    for action in FORBIDDEN_ACTIONS:
        if action in query.upper():
            raise SecurityError(f"Execution of {action} is forbidden")
    # ... execute query
```

This is protection at the code level, not the prompt level.

Why? Because **prompt injection can bypass instructions, but it can’t bypass enforced code logic.**

### 3) Model choice: choosing Gemini Pro isn’t only about capability

![Model choice: risk & compliance considerations](/assets/images/openclaw-security-slide-07.png)

Model capability? All three major vendors are good enough.

I chose Gemini Pro for one reason: **Google has the highest cost of a data leak.**

Among the “big three”:
- OpenAI and Anthropic are still essentially startups
- Google is a public company, with a different level of compliance requirements

If something goes wrong, Google’s legal and PR costs are enormous—so they have the strongest incentive to protect customer data.

This is risk management, not a pure technical benchmark.

### 4) Never give it a dashboard or SSH access

![Connection control: no root privileges](/assets/images/openclaw-security-slide-05.png)

A new hire shouldn’t have root access. Neither should AI.

**No dashboard access. No direct SSH.**

Always use controlled connectivity like **tunneling or Tailscale**.

All operations should go through defined Skill interfaces.

### 5) Never install external Skills into OpenClaw

![Skill extension: refuse external black boxes](/assets/images/openclaw-security-slide-08.png)

Skills are powerful—but they’re also a big security risk.

**Never use third-party Skills. Build your own for your own use.**

It’s not hard anyway.

Problems with external Skills:
- You don’t know what code is inside
- There could be backdoors or data exfiltration
- Updates could introduce malicious logic

Benefits of writing your own Skills:
- Fully transparent code
- Auditable
- Controllable

## Email: the highest risk, so the strictest rules

![Email management: the highest-risk touchpoint](/assets/images/openclaw-security-slide-09.png)

Email is the highest-risk component in the whole architecture.

Why? Because **email is the only channel that can receive completely external input**.

Anyone can send you an email, including attackers. They can hide prompt-injection instructions inside the message.

### My approach: the agent does NOT automatically read my inbox

OpenClaw does not proactively scan my email.

Like an assistant, it waits for me to delegate—**I decide what should be handled by this “employee,” then I forward it.**

### Two-layer filtering

**System-generated emails (auto-forward):**
- Many system notifications like JIRA or internal tools
- Use Gmail filters to forward directly to OpenClaw for summarization
- Almost no chance of prompt injection

**External emails (manual filter):**
- Everything else: I only forward when I think it’s needed
- Bank, legal, sensitive client emails → never forward

### Python middleware: sanitize in code, not in the LLM

![Data sanitization: Python middleware](/assets/images/openclaw-security-slide-10.png)

OpenClaw reads email via a Skill, and the LLM doesn’t see raw messages directly.

A Python middleware layer first transforms it into clean, auditable JSON:

```python
def sanitize_email(raw_email):
    """
    Produce clean, auditable JSON.
    The LLM only sees this, not the original HTML.
    """
    return {
        "msg_title": extract_subject(raw_email),
        "content": extract_plain_text(raw_email),  # plain text only
        "from": extract_sender(raw_email),
        "timestamp": extract_date(raw_email)
    }
```

Then OpenClaw reads something like:

```json
{
  "msg_title": "[Project A] Requirement confirmation",
  "content": "Hi Wisely, the requirement spec for Project A has been updated...",
  "from": "pm@company.com",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-07T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Key point: sanitize with code, not with the LLM.**

- LLM sanitization = can be bypassed by prompt injection
- Code sanitization = fixed logic that can’t be “talked around”

Another important point: **avoid exposing the OpenClaw email address externally**, which reduces the chance of receiving targeted prompt-injection messages.

## Honestly: this is more annoying

![Costs and benefits](/assets/images/openclaw-security-slide-11.png)

Yes, I admit it.

The costs of this architecture:
- AI can’t see all of your historical context
- Some automation becomes slower
- Setup is much harder than “just give it permission”

But it buys you something extremely important:

**The company dares to hand information to an agent.**

## Conclusion: manage AI the way you manage a new hire

![Conclusion: manage AI the way you manage a new hire](/assets/images/openclaw-security-slide-12.png)

When a new employee joins, you gradually learn how to work together.

You assign appropriate tasks. Build trust. Expand permissions.

Even with humans, you still isolate information by sensitivity level.

**Not because you don’t trust them, but because you plan to work together long-term.**

AI agents are the same.

Manage AI the way you manage a new hire.
